## Document 3 potential ideas for your final.

### Idea_01: Improving My Project of Midterm;
For my midterm project, I got many feedbacks in the class -- about its style and how to make guides step by step during the tutorial. 

I want my final project to respond to this feedbacks, and then transform the behaviors of users, which mainly is "click" on the panel beneath previously, to "drag" in the scene. I think in this way, audiences will have a deeper memory of this structure. 

### Idea_02: A Tutorial of Morse Code;

One thing that I found extremely interesting is that how meanings translated among different medias.

So I thought about Morse Code.

In the system of Morse Code, a specific letter is linked with a certain image and sound.

And with collective presenting of language, image, and sound, I think it definitely will facilitate the learning of Morse Code. 

Finally we can add the behaviors(like hiting the desk, taping the button of LittleBit or shouting to the air) of users to improve this learning process to next level.


### Idea_03: Visualize Music;

After watching the tutorial about p5.sound library, I found that p5 gives us a chance to make interesting connection between image and sound. 

More specifically, it can help us making connection between the elements in the physical world with the elements in the world of sound. 

In fact, they are in the same world, while the former is in the macroscale and the later one is in the microsale. Making different mataphors among them would be really interering! 





## If you have an idea or concept, document 3 different experiences.
It is an experiment of making connection between Images and Sounds.

It can be a tool that users can install the music they like in and making dynamic images. Users can create videos by editing the elements of the music. 

It can be a tool that help instruments beginners to visualize the various elements of pieces they are studying to memorize them.

I expect that users can edit the images independently without losing the connection with the sounds that every user will have an unique video of their own based on their own interpretation of the music.

Also if I change the input to the microphone, it might become a game that powered by the sound made by players in the real world.
