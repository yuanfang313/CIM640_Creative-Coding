## The Dynamic Demonstration of Dougong

### Motivation:
I made it as a part of tutorial to facilitate learning, to help people see through the structure of Dougong.
And based on the same method and theory we can apply it to many other subjects, especially those emphasizing structure memorizing like Anatomy. Further more, we can add some functions that's enable users to edit the dynamic graphics themselves, like adding the sound them like when it's playing over every step. Study has shown that contents added or marked with something from leaners will facilitate learning.  

### Inputs:
mousePressed, keyPressed;

### Outputs:
play, stop, forward, back, reset, speed select;

### Target Audiences:
People studying or interested in Traditional Chinese Architecture.

### Where to display:
Maybe beside a video tutorial about the structure of Traditional Chinese Architecture.
