### I used "loadSound()" from p5.sound.

One thing that I found extremely interesting is that how meanings translated among different medias.

So I thought about Morse Code.

In the system of Morse Code, a specific letter is linked with a certain image and sound. 

### I linked the load of "image" and "sound" with "hitzone" leting three events happen at the same time. 

In this way I linked image, sound and language together.

And with collective presenting of language, image, and sound, it definitely will facilitate the learning of Morse Code.

Finally we can add the behaviors(like hiting the desk, or shouting to the air) of users to improve this learning process 
next level.
